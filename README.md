# Lenovo 3-Way Trackpad Buttons Fix
## For use with older Versions of the T-Series

This is a Windows Registry fix to enable the trackpad buttons on Windows 8 and above.

The Problem is, after installing the new trackpad the newest driver installed automaticly through windows update with a wrong trackpad configuration. Based on your model it configures the standard trackpad, which in the case of the T440/T440s has no buttons.

Currently it's tested with the T440 and T440s.

# How to apply the Fix

1. [Install the 3-Way Trackpad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rkjtd6sMcA) (Recommended Youtube How-To for the T440s)
2. Add these registry entries manually or by running the .reg file.
